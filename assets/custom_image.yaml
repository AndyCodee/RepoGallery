# This file contains the custom images that you want to use in your RepoGallery page.
#
# Syntax: project_name: image_path
# project_name: The project name should be STRICTLY THE SAME as the repository name.
# image_path: The image path can be a URL or a local path.
#             If it's a local path, it should be relative to the root of the repository.
#
# Example:
# ProjectA: https://example.com/imageA.jpg
# ProjectB: /path/to/imageB.png
#
# Note: If you want to use this feature, you need to set use_custom_image to true in config.yaml.
#       You can only use the custom image for a specific project, otherwise,
#       if the random_image is set to true, the random image will be shown,
#       if the random_image is set to false, the first image in the repo README will be shown.
